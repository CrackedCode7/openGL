Current item(s) to work on:
    - Camera rotation
    - Look into coloring different faces different colors. Specifically, how does the coloring work when we have
      an EBO with indics for the vertices, then a regular VBO for the colors? Maybe I should set up an EBO
      for the colors so that we can control the color of each vertex (I think this makes sense).
	- Textures (testing, so I need to try to set half of a face to some color, etc.)


Current method of polling for events can miss events. Need to switch the input handling to a callback in the future.
