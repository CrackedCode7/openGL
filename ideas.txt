Current item(s) to work on:
  
  - 2D UI elements over 3D
  
  - Need to prevent the user from looking up or down past the flipping point. If we are within five degrees
    or something we need to prevent it from going further.

  - System to take all cubes (eventually objects) we want to draw, map vertex info and indexing to a global
    index. Then combine all the vertices into one array (keeping colors in mind as well) and draw with
    glDrawElements. Size will be 36 times cube number, even with indexing.


Current method of polling for events can miss events. Need to switch the input handling to a callback in the future.
