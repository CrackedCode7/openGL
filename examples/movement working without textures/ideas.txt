Current item(s) to work on:

  - Look into coloring different faces different colors. Specifically, how does the coloring work when we have
    an EBO with indics for the vertices, then a regular VBO for the colors? Maybe I should set up an EBO
    for the colors so that we can control the color of each vertex (I think this makes sense).

	- Textures (testing, so I need to try to set half of a face to some color, etc.)

  - System to take all cubes (eventually objects) we want to draw, map vertex info and indexing to a global
    index. Then combine all the vertices into one array (keeping colors in mind as well) and draw with
    glDrawElements. Size will be 36 times cube number, even with indexing.


Current method of polling for events can miss events. Need to switch the input handling to a callback in the future.
